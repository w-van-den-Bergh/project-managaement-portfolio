## Isostatic Press Pilot Run of Hazardous Samples

**Summary:** A technique for material desertification known as isostatic pressing was proposed and approved for a pilot run. A sample manifest was created and sample preparation was coordinated across teams for a total of ~150 samples. Samples were shipped, treated, and returned to be tested.

**Role and Contributions:** From my proposal, I was assigned as project manager for the pilot run. I was in charge of the sample manifest which involved coordinating with different teams to determine what samples would be provided from each team. Furthermore, I handled the logistics of preparation and safe transport of hazardous samples for testing. Lastly, updates were provided to stakeholders on a regular basis.

**Deliverables:** Prepare a set of samples from all teams in the US R&D department as manifest to be sent, treated under two different conditions, and then returned for testing.

**Results:** Samples were organized and cataloged before sent and treated by the business partner without issue. Subsequent testing found notable improvements to the treated samples compared to baseline. These findings and associated documentation were organized and presented to the key stakeholders to present as a case for additional treatments.
