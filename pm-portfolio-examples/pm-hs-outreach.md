## Outreach program for highschool students to learn about batteries

**Summary:** A local teacher was awarded extra funding to add a unique science unit to her curriculum so that her students could understand the fundamentals of diffusion and Li-ion batteries.

**Role and Contributions:** Along with a fellow lab mate, were assigned with coordinating with the teacher to develop lesson plans and assignments for the students to see what goes on in a university lab and to teach them the fundamental concepts of diffusion (in this case Li-ions) and how modern Li-ion batteries function.

**Deliverables:** Prepare two major assignments and lesson plans for the students. In addition, plan and manage a tour of the labs including a demonstration of Li-ion charging-discharging in action. 

**Results:** The assignments were prepared and approved by stakeholders and the tour was completed without issue.
