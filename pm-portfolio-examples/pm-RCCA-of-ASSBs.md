## RCCA of All-Solid-State Batteries

**Summary:** With a change in formulation of one of the battery components, there was an sudden increase in cell failure rate early on in its cycle lifetime. I was tasked with working with selected team members and constructing an RCCA with the goal of finding the root cause and delivering a proposed solution to the problem.

**Role and Contributions:** My role consisted of being the project manager for this RCCA which involved laying out the 5-Whys RCCA tree, managing documentation, coordinating experiments with team members, and updating stakeholders on progress.

**Deliverables:** The ultimate deliverable was to isolate the root cause and provide a proposed solution.

**Results:** Detailed documentation with supporting evidence from experiments and literature research lead the team to root cause with further research providing a possible solution. These findings were compiled into a report and presented to the key stakeholders for a higher level decision.
