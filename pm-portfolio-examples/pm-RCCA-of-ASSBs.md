## RCCA of All-Solid-State Batteries

**Summary:** Selected to lead a team of scientists and engineers on a root cause corrective analysis (RCCA) project for the root cause of an observed increased in failure rate of battery cells. This began with the create of associated project management documentation, RCCA analysis chart, and the outline of an anticipated report.

**Objective:** To perform an RCCA and provide a report to key stakeholders complete with an explanation of the root cause and a proposed solution to the problem.

**Role:** My role in the project consisted of preparing the associated project management documentation such as RACI chart, project charter, and Gantt chart. In addition, I was in charge of managing the RCCA documentation, and the accumulated knowledge from experiments and associated literature research. As project lead, I was chosen to update key stakeholders and pass on any information to my team members. Team members were given portions of the RCCA project and were given regular check-ins to see what logistical issues or updates they may have to either facilitate or update, respectively.

**Outcome:** The outcome of the project was a completion of the RCCA project with all goals met. This included clear documentation of the progress, a compiled report with supporting evidence for our conclusions, and a presentation to the department on our findings complete with a proposed solution.
