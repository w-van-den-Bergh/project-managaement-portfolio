## Writing papers

**Summary:** Academic papers require the coordination of authors, editors, and peer-reviewers. The first author is the responsible party for managing writing, edits, submission, and proofing. Here I lay out the general process through a project management lens.

**Role and Contributions:** As first author, I was the responsible party for writing contributions, edits, submission, revisions, and proofing. This includes coordinating with secondary authors and laying out what sections they ought to contribute, experiments and scientific figures to be included in the paper, and submission process which involves liaisons with an editor.

**Deliverables:** Submit a publication worthy academic paper to a well-respected and peer reviewed journal.

**Results:** Peer reviewed academic papers in well respected journals, 7 times over. [Link](https://github.com/w-van-den-Bergh/resume_CV?tab=readme-ov-file#publications-patents-and-presentations)
