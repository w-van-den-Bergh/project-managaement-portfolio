## Development of novel synthesis for cathode active materials

**Summary:** Assigned as the lead scientist in charge or research and project management for the synthesis of cathode active materials for the purpose of patent development and academic publication (not in pursuit of degree) as a joint project between KIT and BASF. This involved managing documentation, updating stakeholders, and coordinating with team members and members of partner organizations. This resulted in two patents and five scientific publications.

**Role:** Managed project management documentation, scientific data, updates with stakeholders, and direction of research which was passed onto team members to conduct experiments.

**Objective:** Develop novel synthesis methods for cathode active materials for the purpose of patent development and/or academic publication (not in pursuit of degree).

**Outcome:** Delivered two patents and five scientific publications. In addition developed two unique synthesis techniques which led to the patents.</br>
Patent #s WO 2025/061478 A1 and WO 2024/240593 A1 </br>
