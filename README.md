Below is a list of projects that I have managed, each link contains further details on the project

### RCCA analysis of solid-state batteries
**Summary:** As the team transitioned to a new formulation, members of the team began to notice increased failure rates. I was assigned to lead a task force to find the root cause of this issue. From a series of experiments and data analysis, a root cause was deduced and a solution was proposed to managemnet.

### Sample management and preparation of solid-state cells and samples for isostatic pressing
**Summary:** Based on literature findings, I proposed a technique that was new to the field and was greenlit for a pilot run. Coordinating across teams and companies, over 150 samples were prepared and treated with subsequent testing.
